# Sales Taxes (a.k.a Foobar Market)
A ludicrously simple e-commerce. 
Products are called "Poiuyts". Every Poiuyt belongs to one or more Categories, and every Category is associated with one and only one Fee, an object which represents a tax (or a discount if the value is negative).

# Technologies

- Spring Boot
