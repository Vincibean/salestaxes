			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			<p id="smalltext">FooBar Market is the largest Poiuyt in human
				history. From 1432, people at FooBar are totally committed to
				helping mankind buy, sell, and share Poiuyts.</p>
			<h2>How It All Began</h2>
			<p id="smalltext">
				It all began in 1432, when Alfred Foo van Bar felt compelled to
				create something no one ever dared before: creating a Poiuyt market.
				<br /> While first looked down by all of his colleagues, he
				strongly believed in his commercial idea, and in June 1432 he
				resigned from his dog-sitting career to open a place where Poiuyts
				could flow freely. <br /> He named the place after his daughter,
				FooBar Foo van Bar.
			</p>
			<h2>Beginning and First Skepticism</h2>
			<p id="smalltext">While today Alfred Foo van Bar is
				universally considered a genius and the greatest man who ever lived
				(no, we are not telling you this because we were paid shamefully
				much, we really mean it!), FooBar Market was first regarded with
				skepticism. However, thanks to his brilliant mind and the constant
				support of his family, Alfred Foo van Bar kept on pursuing his drean
				untill the day of his death, when FooBar Market had already become a
				fearsome company.</p>
			<h2>New Guide, New Successes</h2>
			<p id="smalltext">After his father's death, FooBar Foo van Bar followed in his
				father's footsteps, increasing the already enormous family wealth.</p>
